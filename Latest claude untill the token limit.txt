> The main window is not user friendly. How can we simplify the main window so that the existing
scheduled commercials are shown in the top 1/3rd portion of the windo, the commercial library
datagrid in the next 1/3rd height, and the playlist creater in the their 1/3 height. Users should
 be able to search the libray in the middle portion, drag and drop files into the playlist area,
arrange them in the required order and schedule for particular date, time and to date so that it
is updated in the x locations and database, then populated into the top scheduled commercials grid
 view. Plan for easy user operations. Show a horizontal wavefrom below the playlist editer
portion. Whenever the channel selected is changed, everything is to be auto-loaded or refreshed.

● I'll explore the codebase to understand the current MainWindow structure and related components before designing the simplified layout.

● I've completed exploring the codebase. Before designing the implementation plan, I have a few clarifying questions:

● User answered Claude's questions:
  ⎿  · Should this new unified layout replace the current navigation-based MainWindow entirely, or
      be an additional view mode that users can switch to? → Edit the left button panels for the
     best match with the three section layout.
     · For the top 'Scheduled Commercials' grid, what time range should it display? → All
     Scheduled commercials with default sort by transmission date
     · Should users be able to edit or delete schedules directly from the top grid? → Full
     edit/delete
     · What should the horizontal waveform display? → When an item is clicked in the library, then
      that items waveform, if a schedule is clicked, then the full capsule waveform with multi
     color segments for multiple cuts. When an item is dropped into the playlist creator, add each
      item wavefom and apped each item with colour coded segments for each cur in the order.


● Now I have clear requirements. Let me launch a Plan agent to design the implementation approach.
